		<h1>The Han Dynasty</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Second great imperial dynasty of China.</h2>
			<p><b><u>The han dynasty</b></u> was founded by Liu 			Bang, later the Gaozu emperor (reigned 206â€“195 bce), a 			man of humble birth who led the revolt against the 			repressive policies of the preceding short-lived Qin 			dynasty.</p>
			<p><b><u>The Han</b></u> copied the highly centralized 			Qin administrative structure, dividing the country 			into a series of administrative areas ruled by 				centrally appointed officials and developing a 				salaried bureaucracy in which promotion was based 			primarily on merit.</p>
